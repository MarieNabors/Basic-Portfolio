      <p> I was born in Tallahassee, FL in 1981. My career began as a teacher, and my background in education has developed within me a deep apprecation for technology and all the ways it enriches life. </p>
        <p>In schools, computers and mobile devices dynamically shape the teaching and learning process by engaging students at all levels. Tech provides teachers with powerful tools to save time, open countless windows to new knowledge, and increase professional collaboration globally.</p>

      <p> Currently, I am an emerging web devloper enrolled in the coding bootcamp at the University of Central Florida. In true teacher fashion, I enjoy collaborating, exploring, experimenting, designing, writing, and creating meaningful projects. I also enjoy the challenges of problem solving, editing, and debugging. I'm a natural team-player, focusing on meeting goals, helping others, and improving life with the power of web development.</p>
